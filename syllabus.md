## What is this?
[SFPC](http://sfpc.io/) is an artist-led school that meets in the Lower East Side in New York City. The main classes revolve around hardware, software and theory. Last semester's [Critical Theory of Technology](https://github.com/allisonburtch/Critical-Theory-of-Technology/blob/master/syllabus.md) class created a zine, which is available for download from the github repo.

## Course description
With Silicon Valley being both a hegemonic power and an HBO sitcom, the drone war killing from afar, the sharing economy economizing our datafied lives, ever-present algorithms modifying our behaviour, smart phones changing out psychology, and some people only experiencing the 'Internet' through facebook's internet.org, what is the role of the creative technologist? 

Alain Badiou, in the first paragraph of _The Rebirth of History_, asks this:  

> "What is going on? Of what are we the half-fascinated, half-devastated witnesses? The continuation, at all costs, of a weary world? A salutary crisis of that world, racked by its victorious expansion? The end of that world? The advent of a different world? What is happening to us in the early years of the century - something that would appear not to have any clear name in any accepted language?"

And so we see the fire in the distance, but we continue forward. And yet, that's not the end of the story. Global uprisings have never been more connected, and the internet has brought the potential for a global system of information. Art, activism and connection have never been more powerful. 

So where is the beauty, the art, the activism that is truly changing things. 

This class, 


How, as technologists, do we frame the things we make? What is the role of art? 

Shit is fucked up and bullshit, and we know it. We can't make rent so we sleep at our boyfriend's and airbnb our rooms. Time in your car is now time being an Uber driver. Sell your eggs, sell your sperm, sell your life.

online, we see continued escapades into revolutionary connections and sharing information, and a continued barbarism that devlves into trolling. 

The first thing that the internet brings globally is pornography. (this is how _we_ treat _our_ women #merika)

And yet, and yet. 

brave new machines
creating liberation technologies in this world
maybe that's a little too heavy handed

so how do i take this from really general to more specific??

this class will have a focus on the media art interventions used to circumvent the current global crises
what is performance, communicty building, art, etc
there will be at least one week where we talk about success stories of activism and global uprising and radical peoeple 

we talked about

## Week 1
* Thursday, March 19th, 2015
* In Class
	* What is the influence of algorithms on politics and the global economy? In this class we'll watch [All Watched Over by Machines of Love and Grace](https://vimeo.com/38724174) and discuss the goals for the semester.

## Week 2
### Critical Engineering
In this class we read the [Critical Engineering Manifesto](http://criticalengineering.org/) by Julian Oliver, Gordan Savičić, Danja Vasiliev and other examples of critical engineering used in art and technology.
 "0. The Critical Engineer considers Engineering to be the most transformative language of our time, shaping the way we move, communicate and think. It is the work of the Critical Engineer to study and exploit this language, exposing its influence.""

		*  (1994 – 2003) - The Bureau was formed in Melbourne Australia in 1991 by Natalie Jeremijenko and Kate Rich and incorporated in the Cayman Islands in 1992 working with Information Technology as its primary material, re-engineering technical systems to address the hidden politics of technology. The anonymity of the Bureau was in part a strategy to reflect on the anonymity of technical production – the diffused accountability and ethnographic anonymity in which information technologies and software are generally produced.

But I want my readers to be very clear that what is "utopian" in my vision and in this book is a particular way of using computers, of forging new relationships between computers and people -- that the computer will be there to be used is simply a conservative premise"

## Week 5
4/16 - Decentralization (subject to change)
<em>Decentralized computing, decentralized political organizing, decentralized currencies.</em>
Global, [decentralized networds of computers](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/opinion/sunday/fixing-the-digital-economy.html) have disrupted the way we communicate, seemingly leading to a more democratic society. Simultaneously, we've seen a massive centralization of power and wealth. _Protocol_ introduces us to how control can exist after decentralization.
* Readings
	* Alexander Galloway, _Protocol_, pgs 3-53 (Introduction and Ch 1 'Physical Media,' though the whole book is worth reading)
	* [21 Technologies That Will Decentralize the World](http://www.shareable.net/blog/21-technologies-that-will-decentralize-the-world)
	* Jo Freeman, "[The Tyranny of Structurelessness](http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/tyrstruct.html)"
	* Bitcoin
		- "[Why Bitcoin Matters](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters/)," Marc Andreesen
		- "[Bitcoin is the offshore tax haven of the future](http://www.dailydot.com/business/bitcoin-offshore-tax-haven/)," Aaron Sankin 

## Week 6
4/23 - How does political change happen? How to groups of people fight power? Examples of success stories. Though we see nothing but horror and bleakness in the news, where is hope?
	* Examples: Zapatistas, Occupy Wall St, #blacklivesmatter

## Week 7 
4/30 - Art and the Art World

## Week 8 - TBD, brainstorming and working on final class project

* Finish final class project
