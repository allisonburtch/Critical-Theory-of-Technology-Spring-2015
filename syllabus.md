## What is this?
[SFPC](http://sfpc.io/) is an artist-led school that meets in the Lower East Side in New York City. The main classes revolve around hardware, software and theory. Last semester's [Critical Theory of Technology](https://github.com/allisonburtch/Critical-Theory-of-Technology/blob/master/syllabus.md) class created a zine, which is available for download from the github repo.

## Course description
With Silicon Valley being both a hegemonic power and an HBO sitcom, the drone technology allowing killing from afar, the 'sharing economy' capitalizing our free time and free space, ever-present algorithms modifying our shopping behaviour, smart phones changing out psychology, and some people only experiencing the 'Internet' through facebook's internet.org, what is the role of the creative technologist? 


Alain Badiou, in the first paragraph of _The Rebirth of History_, asks this:  

> "What is going on? Of what are we the half-fascinated, half-devastated witnesses? The continuation, at all costs, of a weary world? A salutary crisis of that world, racked by its victorious expansion? The end of that world? The advent of a different world? What is happening to us in the early years of the century - something that would appear not to have any clear name in any accepted language?"

  
And so though we see the fire in the distance, but we continue forward. And yet, that's not the end of the story. Global uprisings have never been more connected, and the internet has brought the potential for a global system of information. Art, activism and connection have never been more powerful. 

This class will discuss the role of artists and technologists in this increasing inequal power dynamic of society. How can we create critical engineering --liberation technologies and art that celebrates the human experience-- in an increasingly volatile technological space. What intervientions have been successful? What happens when groups organize via the internet? 

The final project will be decided by the class, and can be either a text-based zine or collaboration on projects.


## Expectations and Structure

* Read all the material and come prepared to discuss it in depth. Please bring other resources, authors and artists that you find relevant.
* As this is primarily a discussion-based class, let's have all laptops closed. See [Clay Shirky's post on Medium](https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368) about how this is better for everyone.
* Brainstorm and create a final class project.
* Blog weekly about the readings and your thoughts.

## Recommended Reading

We won't be able to read these books in full, but I highly recommend you read them at some point in your life.
* Alan Badiou, _The Rebirth of History: Times of Riots and Uprisings_
* Doris Lessing, _The Golden Notebook_
* Ursula K. Le Guin, _The Dispossessed_
* Alexander Galloway, _Protocol_

## Week 1
* Thursday, March 19th, 2015
* In Class
	* What is the influence of algorithms on politics and the global economy? In this class we'll watch [All Watched Over by Machines of Love and Grace](https://vimeo.com/38724174) and discuss the goals for the semester.

## Week 2
### Critical Engineering
In this class we read the [Critical Engineering Manifesto](http://criticalengineering.org/) by Julian Oliver, Gordan Savičić, Danja Vasiliev and other examples of critical engineering used in art and technology.
 "0. The Critical Engineer considers Engineering to be the most transformative language of our time, shaping the way we move, communicate and think. It is the work of the Critical Engineer to study and exploit this language, exposing its influence.""
* Thursday, March 26th, 2015
* In Class:
	* [Natalie Jerimikenko](http://www.nataliejeremijenko.com/projects/): Basically made every tech/art project in the 1990s [http://www.bureauit.org/](bureau of inverse technology), [bit anti-terror line](http://www.bureauit.org/antiterror/)
		*  (1994 – 2003) - The Bureau was formed in Melbourne Australia in 1991 by Natalie Jeremijenko and Kate Rich and incorporated in the Cayman Islands in 1992 working with Information Technology as its primary material, re-engineering technical systems to address the hidden politics of technology. The anonymity of the Bureau was in part a strategy to reflect on the anonymity of technical production – the diffused accountability and ethnographic anonymity in which information technologies and software are generally produced.

But I want my readers to be very clear that what is "utopian" in my vision and in this book is a particular way of using computers, of forging new relationships between computers and people -- that the computer will be there to be used is simply a conservative premise"

Phil Agre has a bit of an [interesting disappearance story](http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2009/11/the_mysterious_disappearance_o.html).
* Philip E. Agre, "[Surveillance and Capture: Two Models of Privacy](http://www.asounder.org/resources/agre_surveillance.pdf), 1994.
Skim this, it's not necessary but good for historical context.

## Week 5
4/16 - Decentralization Part I
In class: presentation of your Periscope projects, with both the rules and the documentation
<em>Decentralized computing, decentralized political organizing, decentralized currencies.</em>
Global, [decentralized networds of computers](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/opinion/sunday/fixing-the-digital-economy.html) have disrupted the way we communicate, seemingly leading to a more democratic society. Simultaneously, we've seen a massive centralization of power and wealth. _Protocol_ introduces us to how control can exist after decentralization.
* Readings
	* Alexander Galloway, _Protocol_, split into groups reading the Introduction and Chapters 1-4, with presentations in class



## Week 6
4/23 Decentralization Part II

* Jo Freeman, "[The Tyranny of Structurelessness](http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/tyrstruct.html)"
	* Bitcoin
		- "[Why Bitcoin Matters](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters/)," Marc Andreesen
		- "[Bitcoin is the offshore tax haven of the future](http://www.dailydot.com/business/bitcoin-offshore-tax-haven/)," Aaron Sankin 
	* [21 Technologies That Will Decentralize the World](http://www.shareable.net/blog/21-technologies-that-will-decentralize-the-world)


## Week 7 
4/23 - How does political change happen? How to groups of people fight power? What are some examples of success stories? Though we see nothing but horror and bleakness in the news, where is hope? 
Homework: 
1. Many of these fights have been local and small but effective. Where do you see hope? Where do you see people working together for justice? Share something that perhaps only you know about
	* Examples: Zapatistas, Occupy Wall St, #blacklivesmatter
2. The discussion in class was how to best document some of the issues and topics covered in class. What questions would you like to be answering? We'll compile some of the questions and answer them next week


## Week 8 
4/30 

Critique/feedback on final projects. We can set up groups of perhaps 5 or 6 at a time. 

* Finish final class project
